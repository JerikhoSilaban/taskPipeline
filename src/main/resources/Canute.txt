Canute was a great king| He was also a great soldier| He feared God| He loved his people| One day he went to the sea-shore| He sat on a chair close to the water| His friends stood behind him|

One of the friends said, “My Lord! You are the master of the world| Even the waves of the sea will obey your orders|"

The king said nothing in reply| He turned to the waves and said, “This is my order to you| Don’t come near me| Go back! I am your master| Obey me!"

But the waves came nearer| They flowed over the king’s feet|

The kin then said to his friend, “I am not great! God alone is great! He rules the world| The Sun, The Moon, The Stars and The Sea obey only His Orders|"

Canute put aside his crown| He did not wear it from that day| 
It was a bright and sunny morning| Little Shyam was very excited| It was his first day at school|

“Mother," he called out| “Where is my lunch? If I do not hurry, I won’t get to school on time|"

Shyam’s school was across the forest and it would take him an hour to get there| Mother quickly gave him his lunch and sent him on his way|

Shyam skipped along the forest path| He loved to watch the sunlight peeping between the trees and the sounds of the birds chirping|

He soon reached scholl and ran in to meet his friends from the village| He had a wonderful time in school|

Shyam learnt many new things at school and the day was soon over| It was evening and Shyam was his way back home|

But the forest in the evening was very scary| There were many strange sounds and shapes that scared little Shyam|

Suddenly, “Hoooot" came a loud sound in the dark|

“AH!" screamed Shyam in fear|

He was so scared that he did not stop to find out what had made the sound| He just ran as fast as he could until he reached home|

Mother was very worried to see Shyam crying|

“What happened Shyam?" she asked|

“I will not go to school again|" He sobbed|

“The forest is very dark in the evenings and I am scared to walk all alone|"

“How can I help Shyma get over his fear?" she wondered|

Suddenly she came up with a plan|

“Shyam, when you feel scared, just close your eyes and call out for your brother Gopal| He will come and help you," she said|

“I did not know that I had a brother," said a surprised Shyam|

“You always had a brother| You only never thought of him," said his mother|

“Now go and wash your hands and I will get you some food," said mother with a smile|

SHyam was satisfied| His brother Gopal would help him| He had nothing to worry about| He ate his food and slept in peace|

The next morning Shyam hurried to school| In the evening, as he was coming home, the forest scared him again| He decided to call his brother|

“Brother Gopal, where are you? Please come and take me home," he called out|

As Shyam looked about, a melodious music filled the forest| Suddenly out of no where a boy appeared and walked up to Shyam|

He looked charming with dark skin and a mischievous smile| He took hold of Shyam’s hand and led him to the end of the forest| Shyam was delighted|

Every evening from that day on, Gopal would arrive to take Shyam back home| They would chat and laugh and they became the best friends|

One morning, all the students decided to bring a gift for their teacher on
his birthday the next day|

Shyam did not know what to take as a gift| He decided to ask brother Gopal for advice|

“What gift can I take for my teacher tomorrow?" asked Shyam| Gopal thought for a minute and said, “You can take my bowl of rich curd|"

Shyam was very happy to hear this| He proudly took it to school the next day and gave it to his teacher|

His teacher found the curd very tasty but he realized that no matter how many times he ate from the bowl, the curd never seemed to reduce|

“Shyam," said his teacher, “Where did you get this curd?"

“My brother Gopal gave it to me sir|" Shyam replied|

“What! You do n to have a brother| Do not lie," scolded his teacher|

“I am not lying| Come with me to the forest and I will show you my brother," he said|

His teacher was very angry, but went to the forest with Shyam|

“Where is he? I do not see him|" He yelled|

Just as he raised his hand to whack Shyam, a melodious music filled the forest|

“Only those who are true at heart can see me," came a gentle voice|

“Please forgive me, Lord," said the surprised teacher fallin to his knees|

Shyam also realized that his brother was none other than Lord Goplakrishna| He was very happy to see that The Lord had come to him whenever he called out to him| Do You Still Get Angry? Then you should read this and decide|

One day Buddha was walking through a village| A very angry and rude young man came up and began insulting him, "You have no right teaching, others,' he shouted| “You are as stupid as everyone else| You are nothing but a fake|"

Buddha was not upset by these insults| Instead he asked the young man "Tell me, if you buy a gift for someone and that person does not take it to whom does the gift belong?"

The man was surprised to be asked such a strange question and answered, "It would belong to me| Because I bought the gift|"

The Buddha smiled and said, “That is correct| And it is exactly the same with your anger| If you become angry with me and I do not get insulted, then the anger falls back on you| You are then the only one who becomes unhappy, not me| All you have done is hurt yourself| If you want to stop hurting yourself, you must get rid of your anger and become loving instead| When you hate others, you yourself become unhappy| But when you love others, everyone is happy|" A man stopped one day to help an old lady who was stranded on the side of the road|

He decided to help her, so he stopped his Pontiac next to her Mercedes and got out|

The old lady was a bit frightened and nervous because of his shabby appearance|

The man, sensing this, approached carefully and tried to calm her|

He said to her, “Don’t worry| I’m here to help you| My name is Bryan Anderson|"

He proceeded to fix her flat tire and became dirty and slightly injured in the process|

When he was finished, the lady asked him how much she owed him| He responded by telling her that if she really wanted to repay him, she could pass on the kindness to someone else in their time of need|

Later that evening the lady stopped at a small, dingy cafe| The waitress who served her was pregnant and tired| Despite her apparent exhaustion, the waitress was very sweet and friendly|

The lady wondered how someone who was so tired from a long day of work could still be so friendly and kind to her| Then she remembered Bryan| When the lady finished her meal, she paid with a hundred dollar bill| The waitress went to get change and when she came back, the lady was gone|

She left a note on the napkin…“You don’t owe me anything| Somebody once helped me, just like I’m helping you now| If you really want to pay me back, do not let this chain of love end with you|"

The waitress found four more one hundred dollar bills under the napkin|

That night, the waitress went home early| She thought about the lady and the money she left| She wondered how the lady could possibly know how much they needed it|

She knew her husband was worried and she was worried about him| She couldn’t wait to tell him the good news|

Then she kissed him and whispered…Now everything
will be okay| I love you, Bryan Anderson| Once up a time there were three cows| Daddy cow (also known as a bull), Mummy cow and Baby cow| They lived in a field beside another field that was used as a car park|

The cows did not do very much, all they did was eat grass and chew the cud|

“I’m bored," Baby cow said one day|

“Here the farmer has left the gate open," Mummy cow said|

The three cows looked at each other| They could go into the next field that was full of cars|

“Shhh," said Daddy cow (also known as a bull)| “Let’s go in and see what’s what| There’s nobody about|"

The three cows wandered into the neighboring field and looked about| There were lots of cars| They had seen people get in and out of them and drive them about|

“I want a shot|" Baby cow said|

“OK son," said Daddy cow (also known as a bull), “You go and see if you can get in one|"

Baby cow walked around the car-park, he tried the handles of all the cars until he found one that opened| He used his hoof to open the door and crawled into the driver’s seat|

“Hey look I’m driving a car," he said as he turned the wheel| “Look|"

“Very good son," Mummy cow said| “I bet I can get right round the car-park without touching the ground|

“How are you going to do that?" Daddy cow (also known as a bull) asked|

“By jumping from one car to another|" Mummy cow replied|

“OK, I’ll time you|"

“How are you going to do that?"

“By counting|"

Mummy cow walked over to the nearest car| “Ready," she shouted|

“On your marks, get set, GO|" Then Mummy cow jumped onto the first car and then leaving hoof prints on the bonnet jumped onto the next car leaving a nice cloven-hoofed imprint| She managed to get onto the fifth car before falling onto the ground|"

“That was fun," she said| “how did I do?"

“Three|" Replied Daddy cow (also known as a bull)|

“Three is that all?"

“Well yes, I don’t know what comes after three, so that’s all you managed|" “Right your turn?" I’ll count for you|

So Daddy cow (also known as a bull) jumped onto the first car leaving an even bigger hoof print to the one already there and started jumping from one car to the next| “Hey look this puts some lights on," Baby cow said as he found the lights| Then he found the windscreen wipers| “What are these for?"

“They’re in case your windscreen gets muddy|" Mummy cow said, forgetting
about her counting| “Look I’ll put some mud on them for you|" She then proceeded to kick some mud onto the front of the car| The wipers started to squeak and bend as they struggled to wipe away the mud until they broke|

“Hey, you’re supposed to be timing me|" Daddy cow (also known as a bull) shouted as he slipped off a car|

“Three," Mummy cow shouted| “So it’s a draw|"

“Hey look someone is coming|" Baby cow shouted|

“Quick scarper, back into our field," Daddy cow (also known as a bull) bellowed| The three cows then ran back into their field| Mummy cow caught the gate with a hoof and pulled it shut just as some people walked back into the car park|

The three cows looked at each other and watched as the people walked up and down and scratched their heads| One or two of them looked at the cows and pointed at them and then pointed to the hoof prints on the cars|

The three cows just looked back chewing their cud as cows do|

“Moo," said Mummy cow|

“Moo," replied Baby cow|Once up a time there were three crabs| Daddy crab, Mummy crab and Baby crab|

They lived in a rock pool at the seaside| Twice a day, the tide would come in and refill their rock pool with fresh seawater|

“What’s beyond our rock pool?" Baby crab asked one day|

“Danger," Daddy crab replied, there are seagulls and other things that would eat you|"

“Well I want to see|" Baby crab said|

“No you should stay here|" Mummy crab replied| “You don’t want to go exploring, you might get lost|"

But Baby crab was a naughty crab, he waited until both his parents were asleep under their rocks and the tide was in and then he walked sideways towards the top of the rock pool| He slipped over and suddenly fell into another pool|

He looked about and there were red things sitting on rocks waving| He waved back|

The red things just continued waving| How rude he thought|

He went over to one and touched the red arm| The arms all suddenly shot inside|

“Hello," he said| The red waving things continued to ignore him|

Suddenly he realised that he was all alone and the red waving things no longer looked friendly they looked scary| “Mum, dad," he gurgled, but there was no reply| Suddenly he saw a large orange thing move slowly towards him|

“Where’s my baby?" Mummy crab shouted when she woke up the following morning, getting ready for a good morning of sifting through sand, feeding|"

“I’ll ask the barnacles?" Daddy crab said| He wandered over to the nearest group of barnacles| “Hey barnacles, did you see our son last night?"

“We never saw anything, we’ve been filter-feeding all night," one barnacle said|

“You know we leave each other alone| It’s the first law of the rock-pool, we leave you alone and you leave us alone|" “I think I might have seen him go into the next pool," one barnacle said| “I’m not facing that way, I only saw him out the corner of my eye|"

“Hmmmm," Daddy crab said| “I’ll go and have a look|"

He sidled back to Mummy crab| “One of the barnacles thinks he might have seen him wander into the next rock pool|"

“That’s where…|"

“Yes that’s where the starfish lives|"

“You have to go and get him|" Mummy crab said|

“Yes well you wait here, keep an eye out for seagulls| As it’s no longer high tide, I’m going to have to go… overland|"

“Well be careful| Love you|"

“Love you," said Daddy crab as he walked up to the edge of the rock pool|"

Carefully keeping an eye out for seagulls, he left their pool and made a dash for the next pool|

He saw some sea-anemones waving| No point asking them, everyone knows anemones can’t speak| Now where was that starfish and more importantly, where was his son|

Suddenly there was a shout of “Dad,"

Daddy crab saw his son run
towards him| “Son we were worried, your mother is beside herself with worry|"

“Sorry dad, I wanted to see what was beyond our rock pool|"

“Ah son, we never told you but there’s a starfish that lives here| He can eat you|"

“The starfish won’t eat you| He’s my friend|"

“Now don’t be silly son, we can’t be friends with starfish, they’ve only got five legs| We have eight| Come back with me, we will have to be quick, because there might be seagulls about|"

“Will the seagulls be my friend?"

“No, the seagulls will eat you now follow me|"

“Bye," shouted Baby crab|

Daddy crab was suddenly aware of an orange arm waving back| Starfish whatever next|

The two crabs walked back towards the edge of the rock pool|

Daddy crab kept a look out; there were no seagulls about| “Right now son, run, run as fast you can| Don’t look back we need to move fast as we don’t want to be eaten by seagulls|

Baby crab ran out of the rock pool, over the rocks and back into his home pool and into the welcoming claws of his mother| “Ah son, “ Mummy crab said, she would have had a tear in her eye, but since she was already in water she didn’t|

“I am so glad to see you| Where’s your father?"

“I’m here|" Daddy crab answered|

“Now don’t ever do that again, not until you are a big crab and able to give a seagull a nasty nip|" Mummy crab scolded|

“I won’t," said Baby crab eyeing up the rock pool that lay in the other direction| Dara was a shepherd| He was a good man| He was also a wise man| He became the governor of a province|

Some people do not like Dara| They went to the king and said, “Dara is a thief| He takes money from the people| He keeps the money in a box| He takes the money always with him on his camel|"

The king went to Dara’s province| Dara was then riding on his camel with a box in front of him| The king was angry| He said to Dara, “Open your box now| I want to look into it|"

Dara opened the box| There were only items meant for the shepherd in the box|

Dara said to the king in humble voice, “Thios coat teaches me a lesson| I look at it often| I think of my past| I feel humble|"

The king was glad| He made Dara Governor of one more provinces|

Thereafter the people of the whole country liked Dara|It was Christmas Eve at the North Pole and Father Christmas did what he did every year| He loaded up his sleigh with his sack of toys, hitched the eight reindeer that would be helping him this year and set off on his annual trip delivering presents to children around the world|

The international date line means that Christmas starts in the Pacific and moves west around the world for the next 24 hours, so Santa has a full day to deliver all of the presents to all of the children around the world| Flying down through the Pacific islands, delivering presents on the way, Santa reached the islands of New Zealand|

Now the houses in New Zealand that have chimneys, have very narrow chimneys, so narrow that even Father Christmas has trouble getting down them| He was on one of the last stops in Auckland, New Zealand’s biggest city, when he got stuck in a particularly narrow chimney|

It took several minutes of frantic struggling but eventually Santa managed to free himself, deliver the bike, dolls and pram, remove the soot, have a drink of the brandy that had been left and return to his sleigh which as always was parked on the roof| However, there was one small problem, his glasses had fallen off|

He was halfway to Japan when he realised that he wasn’t able to see as well as he should|

Oh well, he thought, I’ll just have to do without|

Santa was in Japan, when his lack of glasses became a problem| It was night, which it always was when delivering presents, even to those near the South Pole, when Randolph and Tim the two lead reindeer struck one of Japan’s many temples| Santa’s inability to steer properly had become a problem| The sleigh fell over, the reindeer had become separated from it and were looking for some nice fresh Japanese lichens to eat|

Father Christmas picked himself up, turned the sleigh the right way up, picked up his sack and went off to collect the reindeer|

“One, two three four, five, six, seven eight," he counted as he attached each reindeer to its correct position at the front of the sleigh, but Santa had made one mistake|

Instead of attaching Randolph, he had attached a cow|

“Right let’s go, we have presents to deliver and its getting late," Santa shouted from his sleigh, he shook the reigns and seven of the ruminants galloped forwards, taking a very confused cow with them|

The sleigh gathered momentum and started to become airborne, but there was one problem| Cows cannot fly, so as the seven reindeer lifted off the ground, Daisy-san the Japanese cow tumbled and fell|

It was carnage, the sleigh toppled over again, hooves and presents were everywhere|

“Eaten too much Randolph, have you?" Santa said| “I have the very solution|"

Father Christmas rooted around in his multi-dimensional sack until he found what he was looking for, a canister of helium, saved for emergencies such as this| He turned on the gas and tried to fill Daisy up with helium| There are two things you should know| Firstly even when filled with Helium, cows don’t float and secondly cows are very good at producing gases| So Daisy just stood von the ground and occasionally produced belches of helium|

“Right Randolph|" Santa said, as Daisy let go a methane / helium combination, let’s get you hitched up again|

“Wait a minute, you’re not Randolph, who are you? Impostor! Well I never|"

Just then there was the sound of thunder as Daisy let loose some more helium|

“Where’s Randolph? Randolph, where are you? There you are you naughty reindeer, what are you doing over there?"

“Moo," said a very confused cow|

Father Christmas then had to detach Daisy from the sleigh and reattach Randolph|

Soon he had all correct eight animals attached to the sleigh and had managed to set off once more into the night to deliver the hugely-anticipated presents to the rest of the world|Amy's school needed to have a fundraiser so they could earn money to buy more computers| Amy knew that many of her classmates' families were from different countries around the world| They had many special traditions, spoke many different languages and ate many different types of foods|

Amy had a brilliant idea for a fundraiser! She suggested that every student could bring in their favorite dish and hold an ethnic dinner night| She knew parents and members of the community would be glad to pay money in order to try foods from all over the world!

"That's a great idea," Amy's teacher said|

“Let's call it 'Dinner around the World'|"

Amy brought in her favourite meal, chicken with mashed potatoes| Her friend Amina was from Ethiopia, an African country| She brought in stewed meat with spices over rice pilaf with Ethiopian bread| Ibrahim, from Morocco, brought a dish of spiced grilled lamb over white rice with fried eggplant and hummus with pita bread|

Juan, from Mexico, brought chicken fajitas with Spanish rice and tortilla chips with cheese dip| Rajat, whose family is from India, brought in chicken curry over rice with raita, a sauce of yogurt mixed with cucumber| Anita, a vegetarian, brought a meal with no meat| She brought lentil soup, dinner rolls and a salad|

The fundraiser was a great success| Everyone enjoyed seeing, smelling and tasting foods from so many different cultures| In ancient Greece, Socrates was reputed to hold knowledge in high esteem|

One day an acquaintance met the great philosopher and said, "Do you know what I just heard about your friend?"

"Hold on a minute," Socrates replied, "Before you talk to me about my friend, it might be good idea to take a moment and filter what you’re going to say| That’s why I call it the triple filter test| The first filter is Truth| Have you made absolutely sure that what you are about to tell me is true?"

"Well, no," the man said, "actually I just heard about it and…"

"All right," said Socrates, "So, You really did not know if it’s true or not| Now, let’s try the second filter, the filter of Goodness| Is what you are about to tell me about my friend something good?"

“No, on the contrary|||" said the friend|

Socrates continued, “You want to tell me something bad about my friend, but you’re not certain it’s true|"

“You may still pass the test though, because there’s one filter left - the filter of Usefulness| Is what you want to tell me about my friend going to be useful to me?"

"No, not really…|"

“Well…|" Concluded Socrates||||

"If what you want to tell me is neither true, nor good, nor even useful, why tell it to me at all?"

“Do not waste time gossiping kills your energy, the people you are gossiping about and the people you are telling it to…"This Short Story Fair Shares is quite interesting to all the people| Enjoy reading this story|

Ali and Abraham were brothers| Their mother died very early| Their father also died after some time| He left for his sons a cow and a date-tree|

Ali was cunning| He was greedy too| Abraham was kind and honest| He trusted his elder brother| They wanted to divide their father’s property| Ali said, “I will be very fair with you, Abraham| You take the front portion of the cow as your share| I will take the hind side of the cow| Each one gets his profit only from his share|" In the same way the tree was also divided| The upper part of the tree went to Ali| And the lower part of the tree went to Abraham|

Abraham fed the cow very well fresh grass and water| The cow became healthy| It gave lot of milk| Ali got the milk| He sold the milk and got a lot of money| But he did not hare the money with Abraham| Abraham asked his brother about his share of money| Ali replied, “I got the milk from my portion of our cow| Hind part is mine as per the agreement| Each of us gets the benefits only from his part|" Abraham said nothing|

A wise man advised Abraham| He said some thing in the ear of Abraham| The next day Ali was milking the cow| Then Abraham beat the cow in the front portion| The cow started kicking| Ali shouted at Abraham| “You fool! Why do you beat the cow? Do not see me milking the cow?"

“The front portion of the cow is mine| I can do anything| That is our agreement," said Abraham|

Ali could not say anything| Finally he agreed to share the money| Abraham said, “Not just money| You must also share the work of feeding and taking care of the cow too|" Ali agreed|

With regard to the tree, Ali had taken upper part of the tree| He made holes on the upper part of the tree| A kind of sweet-smelling juice came out of these holes| The juice was collected in pots| These pots were kept near the holes| Ali sold the juice for money| But he did not share either the money or
the juice with his brother|

Again the wise man advised Abraham| The next day Ali was on the top of the tree| He was fixing pots near the holes| At that time Abraham was cutting the lower part of the tree| Ali shouted at Abraham| But Abraham reminded Ali about the agreement| He said, “I can do anything with my part| You can not question or stop me|"

Ali now realized his mistakes| He said, “Abraham, I have been a bad brother to you| I feel ashamed of my selfishness| I ask your pardon| I promise to look after you well hereafter|" And so he did| Both the brothers lived happily| They shared the profit| One day I decided to quit my job and to end my life| There seemed to be no reason for me to live any longer|

I quit my job, my relationship, my spirituality…everything… I wanted to quit my life|

I went to the deep-woods to have one last talk with god

“God", I asked,

“Can you give me one good reason not to quit?"|

His answer surprised me…

“Look around", He said| “Do you see the fern and the bamboo ?

“Yes", I replied|

“When I planted the fern and the bamboo seeds, I took very good care of them|

I gave them light|I gave them water|The fern quickly grew from the earth|

Its brilliant green covered the floor|Yet nothing came from the bamboo seed| But I did not quit on the bamboo|In the second year the Fern grew more vibrant and plentiful|

And again, nothing came from the bamboo seed| But I did not quit on the bamboo| He said|

“In year three there was still nothing from the bamboo seed|But I would not quit|

In year four, again, there was nothing from the bamboo seed| I would not quit|" He said|

“Then in the fifth year a tiny sprout emerged from the earth| Compared to the fern it was seemingly small and insignificant…But just 6 months later the bamboo rose to over 100 feet tall|

It had spent the five years growing roots| Those roots made it strong and gave it what it needed to survive|I would not give any of my creations a challenge it could not handle|" He asked me| “Did you know, my child, that all this time you have been struggling, you have actually been growing roots"|

“I would not quit on the bamboo|I will never quit on you|"

“Don’t compare yourself to others|" He said|"The bamboo had a different Purpose than the fern|

Yet they both make the forest beautiful|""Your time will come", God said to me|

“You will rise high"|

“How high should I rise?" I asked|

“How high will the bamboo rise?" He asked in return|

“As high as it can?" I questioned| "Yes|"
He said, “Give Me glory by rising as high as you can|"

I left the forest and brought back this story|I hope these words can help you see that God will never give up on you…… Never, Never, Never Give up

Leo Tolstoy was a great writer| He was a Russian| Tolstoy was a man of peace| He wrote many good stories| Each story has a valuable moral| Some of his stories are log| And some of his stories are short| The following is one of his stories| It is written in simple English for your sake|

It was rainy season in Russia| In a certain village in Russia the rain water was flowing in streams in a street| It had rained and stopped a little while ago| Two little girls were playing in the street water| It was festival time| They were wearing new frocks| Malasha was the younger of the two little girls| Akulya was the older girl|

Malasha stamped her foot in the water| It was a little muddy| The muddy water splashed| It fell on Akulya’s new frock| Akulya was just rubbing out the mud| At that time Akulya’s mother was walking that way| She looked at her daughter’s dress| She scolded her daughter|

“How can you make your new dress so dirty?" she asked|

“Malasha splashed the water on me, mother," said Akulya|

Akulya’s mother caught Malasha| She gave two or three slaps on the back of Malasha| Malasha started weeping loudly| Malasha’s house was close by| Malasha’s mother heard her daughter Malasha’s weeping| She came out in hurry|

“Why are you weeping?" asked her mother|

“Akulya’s mother beat me on my back," said Malasha|

Malasha’s mother turned to Akulya’s mother in an angry mood| Malasha’s mother abused Akulya’s mother| Soon they started quarrelling loudly| They called each other names| Their shouting continued|

Other women joined them soon| Some supported Akulya’s mother| Some supported Malasha’s mother| The two fighting groups became bigger and bigger| The men also joined in the fighting| The quarrel became never ending|

At that time the grandmother of Akulya came out of the house| She told the men and the women not to fight| “It is festival time| People should not quarrel," she told them|No one listened to her| No one cared for her words| In the meantime Malasha and Akulya
forgot about their quarrel| They became friends again| They moved away from the fighting crowd| They started letting paper boats in the running water| Now the old woman said to the fighting groups|

“Look at the children| They have forgotten their quarrel| They have started playing again| They have become friends again| But you men and women still keep quarrelling| Are you not ashamed of your tendency?"

The men and the women looked at the little girls| They felt ashamed| They went back to their houses quietly|

Children forget and forgive very easily| The elders learnt this lesson from the little girls|This Short Story Eureka Eureka is quite interesting to all the people| Enjoy reading this story|

Archimedes was a Greek scientist| He lives in Syracuse nearly 200 years ago| The King of the land wanted to wear a Golden Crown| He gave some gold to a goldsmith to make a suitable crown| After few days, the goldsmith brought the finished crown to the King| The crown was weighed| The weight of the crown was equal to the gold given to the goldsmith by the King| The King looked at the color of the crown|

He had a suspicion| The goldsmith could have stolen some gold from the gold given to him| The King wanted to find out the truth| He asked his court scientist Archimedes to find out| The King said, “Find out how much gold had been stolen?"

How to find out the truth? Archimedes thought about the problem day and night| One day he was about to have his bath, but he was busy thinking| He did not notice the bathtub| The water in the bathtub was already full to the brim| He slid into the bathtub| Immediately a large quantity of water flowed over the brim of the bath tub| He noticed this suddenly| His brain wave worked suddenly| He jumped out of the bathtub, shouting, “Eureka! Eureka!" Eureka in Greek means “I have found it|"

Different metals of the same weight have different volumes| Objects, put in water, will displace water| The displaced water will be equal to their volume|

For example, an iron cube weighing a kilogram will disperse some water| But an aluminums cube of the same weight will displace more water than the iron cube|

Archimedes knew all these theories| Using this as the basic knowledge, Archimedes worked out a plan to find out the purity of the crown| Archimedes took two bowls| He filled them with water to the brim| Then he placed each bowl separately in the middle of the large vessels| He placed the crown in one bowl| Water overflowed| It collected at the bottom of the outer vessel| Then he took a cube of pure gold| This cube of gold was equal in weight to the crown| He kept this gold cube in the middle of the second bowl| Here also water overflowed| Water got collected at the bottom
of the outer bowl|

Archimedes then measured the quantity of water in the two vessels| He found out the difference in the water overflow| The crown had sent out more water| The cube of gold had sent out less water| But both the crown and the gold cube were of the same weight| So, they should have sent out the same quantity of water| Therefore, the crown had some other metals mixed in it| These metals took up more space in the water than pure gold|

Archimedes reported this finding to the King| The King demanded the truth from the goldsmith| The goldsmith then confessed| He had stolen some gold| He had added some other metals| Once five men were caught in a thick forest|

The first man said…|I will go left| Because my intuition said so|

The second one said…|“I will go the right, because the right comes from the word rightness|

The third one said…|I will go back the way we came|

The fourth one said…|I will go straight| We should move forward, the forest will end and we will go somewhere new|

The fifth said…|You are all wrong| There is a better solution| Wait for me|

He climbed the tallest tree he could find while everyone else went their own way|

From above he saw the shortest way to exit| He could also see the order in which the others would exit| He understood the problem and found the best solution!

Long ago, a hawk lived on the top of a hill| At the foot of the hill there was a banyan tree on which a crow used to perch everyday| The crow was very foolish| He would imitate everyone|

The hawk atop the hill would fly down everyday in search of food| The crow watched the hawk circling in the air for long hours and swooping down when he saw his prey| The hawk gifted with eyes that could see long distances would spot his prey from the hill top and then fly down to pounce upon the prey|

The crow watched the hawk thinking, “Hunh! If the hawk can do that, I too can| What does he think? One day, I will show the hawk that I can do the same thing|"

A few days later, as the hawk was circling in the air, the crow decided to do the same| Suddenly a baby rabbit came out of the bushes| The hawk saw it and the crow too saw the rabbit|

Before the crow could move, the hawk swooped down, caught hold of the rabbit in his strong sharp talons and flew away| “Swoosh!" was all the crow heard as the hawk disappeared in the sky with his prey| “Hmmph! That is no great skill," thought the crow, angrily|

Next moment he spotted a big fat mouse coming out of a hole| Without wasting time, the crow swooped down| Like the hawk he tried to catch the mouse in his claws| But the mouse saw the crow and moved away, the crow crashed against the hill| “Eeeaaa!" cried the crow in pain|

Just then the hawk came flying down| “I hope, now you know it is not easy to hunt and it is not easy to imitate, either," said the hawk and flew away|

There after, the crow never imitated any one
in its life| It lived happily with the god-given abilities| A man who was the lone survivor of a terrible shipwreck was washed ashore on a tiny uninhabited island| Marooned and alone, the man cried out to God to rescue him from his terrible fate| Unfamiliar with survival tactics, the man struggled to endure|

Eventually, he was able to construct a hut to protect him and his few possessions| Every day the man faithfully scanned the horizon for the answer to his prayer| One day, after scavenging for food, he arrived home and found his little hut burning to the ground| There was nothing left but ashes and smoke| “God, how could you do this to me!!" He cried| Broken and despaired he sobbed himself to sleep|

The next day, he was awakened by the sound of a ship| It had come to rescue him| He asked the sailor, “How did you know I was here?" "As we were heading East, we saw your smoke signal," the sailor replied|

Lesson : God is working in our lives, even in the midst of our pains and sufferings| We easily get discouraged when things are going bad| But take heart and remember…next time your little hut is burning to the ground| It’s just a smoke signal that attracts God’s blessings| This brought me to tears| What a powerful lesson on time|

A rich man was retiring when an angel of death came to him| He had worked long and hard to acquire massive wealth and retire in luxury, and could not believe that his time was up| Being a very wealthy person, he decided to buy some more time from the angel of death at any cost| He bargained for a long time but the angel was unmoved|

Desperate, the rich man made the last proposal to the angel… Give me just one hour of my life, so that I could admire the beauty of this earth for the last time and spend some time with my family and friends whom I haven't seen for a long time and I will give you all of my wealth| But the angel refused again| Finally, the man asked if the angel could give him at least one minute so that he could write a goodbye note| His wish was granted and he wrote a note…|

"Spend your time, which was given to you, in the right way| I couldn't buy even an hour of life with all of my wealth| Listen to your heart and check if the things surrounding you have a true value| Cherish every minute of your life|"Only those who are capable of being alone are capable of love| The capacity to be alone is the capacity to love| It may look paradoxical to you, but it is not| It is an existential truth…only those people who are capable of being alone are capable of love, of sharing, of going into the deepest core of the other person – without possessing the other, without becoming dependent on the other, without reducing the other to a thing and without becoming addicted to the other|

They allow the other absolute freedom, because they know that if the other leaves, they will be as happy as they are now| Their happiness cannot be taken by the other, because it is not given by the other|This Short Story Good Company and Bad Company is quite interesting to all the people| Enjoy reading this story|
